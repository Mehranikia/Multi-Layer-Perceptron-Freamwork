# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Freamwork
 In this project, we have implemented a method that can segment retinal blood vessels. The method extracts pixel-based features using five groups: edge detection, morphological, statistical, gradient, and Hessian matrix, forming an 18-dimensional feature vector per pixel. These vectors are used to train an artificial neural network. The system was tested on DRIVE dataset.
